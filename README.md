A Ray Traced audio implementation in Minecraft. This was created as part of Summer of Making 2025 by RedDev (me). This is dissimilar to Sound Physics mod because the raycasting is cast from player rather than sound sources (which is theoretically more optimized). Reverb is as accurate as possible using OpenAL. Mod is developed based on the framework discussed in the video A First look at Ray Traced Audio by Vercidium.

tl;dr cool ray traced audio weooooow.

THE MOD IS NOW LIVE ON MODRINTH!! https://modrinth.com/mod/sound-physics-perfected

minecraft is a voxel based game, how hard can it be to implement (famous last words)

Audition works with this mod, highly recommend grabbing if it is available for your version of MC.
